# YAMA: The TTRPG Platform That Got Dangerously Out of Hand

Welcome to the **YAMA System** ‚Äî **Yet Another Modular Adventuring System**.

A name that started with a sensible dose of self-awareness, and has since become a monumental understatement.

## What is this Monstrosity? üßê

It began as a simple, noble goal: build an app for a friend who has written a TTRPG.

Then, I decided that my ambition was to stitch together my old addiction ‚Äî a Rust platform for TTRPGs.

Then, I didn't put these ambitions to rest. And there was nobody to extinguish my flame.

### **The Actual App (YAMA)**

Something that originally was supposed to be narrow scope, single system, simple app with a friendly UI and mobile-first.  
Guess what? It's either cross-platform or no balls.

### **A Whole Dang TTRPG (Exceed)**

The Original System ‚Äî do not copy. It has thousands of lines of markdown detailing everything from magical traits to perks like `Fuck I'm Out` and `The Edgelord`. There are more rules than in the Bible.

### **The Others**

Pathfinder and Starfinder 2E, because I have had a year-long legacy of trying and failing to build an app for them.  
This is it now. Suffer like I did.

## The Tech Stack (aka "The Overkill")

We're using only the most serious and professional technologies to build this unprofessional and unserious project:

- ü¶Ä **Rust:** For when you want to fight the borrow checker instead of dragons.
- ‚ú® **Dioxus:** Because writing your UI once and having it _mostly_ work everywhere is a beautiful lie we choose to believe in.
- üóº **Axum:** The backend that holds our teetering tower of features together with sheer willpower and `async`.
- üé® **TailwindCSS:** Yes, it still has normal CSS, plus CVA-style merge, plus normal Tailwind. Don't bother.

## Current Status

**Hypothetical Progress:** It runs! The UI looks surprisingly slick, and the `exceed` TTRPG is honestly more complete than some published systems.

**Actual Progress:** It runs...on localhost. Deployment pending, please stand by...
